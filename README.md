# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-for-Advanced-Driver-Assistance-System-ADAS-using-Deep-Learning-techniques
The traffic sign recognition system (TSRS) is an important component of an intelligent transportation system (ITS). Being able to interpret traffic signs properly and efficiently can increase driving safety. This project proposes a traffic sign identification approach based on deep learning, which primarily targets at the detection and classification of traffic signs while being trained on a traffic sign benchmark dataset. A traffic sign recognition and identification approach based on image processing is proposed, which is integrated with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify traffic signs. TensorFlow is used to implement CNN. We have 99.4% accuracy in identifying.
